        <h1>üçΩÔ∏è Discovering Moroccan Cuisine</h1>
        <p>As you wander through the bustling streets of Morocco, the enticing aromas of local dishes fill the air. Moroccan cuisine is a feast for the senses, offering a variety of flavors and textures that delight both young and old.</p>
        
        <img src="images/food.jpg" alt="A spread of traditional Moroccan dishes">
        
        <p>One of the most iconic dishes is the <strong>Tagine</strong>, a slow-cooked stew named after the earthenware pot it's cooked in. Tagines can be made with meat, poultry, or vegetables, infused with a blend of spices that create a symphony of flavors.</p>
        
        <p>Another staple is <strong>Couscous</strong>, often considered the national dish of Morocco. This steamed semolina grain is typically served with a hearty mix of vegetables and tender meat, making it a wholesome and satisfying meal.</p>
        
        <p>For a sweet treat, try <strong>Chebakia</strong>, a sesame cookie that's fried and coated in honey, commonly enjoyed during festive occasions.</p>
        
        <p>To quench your thirst, nothing beats a glass of refreshing <strong>Mint Tea</strong>. This sweetened green tea, infused with fresh mint leaves, is a symbol of Moroccan hospitality and is enjoyed throughout the day.</p>
